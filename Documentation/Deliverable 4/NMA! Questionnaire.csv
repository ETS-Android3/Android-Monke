"2022/03/31 9:08:43 PM AST","Tree Growth","I would enjoy seeing interaction between my tree and my friends, like a forest or something where we can show off how great we are at focusing.

Also, I feel like a random tree collection with funky trees like santa trees and other features would be fun to look through (like in neko atsume if you're aware of that ""game"").","Giving boosts to people who are behind or giving (if you focus for 2 hours you get one free kinds of features).","Tie more things to completing tasks as opposed to time spent focusing.  Also allow trees to be ""stable and revistable"" after a certain amount of time spent focused.","Make sure it's low light so it is easier on the batteries while you're using it.  Also, definitely add a bird or summat when the tree is big enough.  Details give interfaces life (not to mention clickable details could be an effective way to track user attention as well).","I feel that the trees should be tied much more strongly to individual tasks rather than time spent in app.","Three times a week","1","2","It's a very elegant app design, I'm just not sure if I can give full marks for navigation when utility of the mobile application isn't fully implemented yet.","Finish it first!  It's very pretty and fun looking, but it's got a few missing pieces (like start new tree or add friends).","Yes"
"2022/03/31 9:12:07 PM AST","Tree Growth","Lots of customization of different trees, colours, seasons, etc. This would let people who use the app feel more connected with the app.","Some kind of fertilizer power-up that applies a bonus if you stay on the app longer than you first set for yourself. This will give people a good feeling that they are doing more then they planned and they are being rewarded for it.","I think the settings tab does not need to have its own big button for it. Unless there are going to be tons of settings I think a small icon in a corner would work better.","Having a widget similar to Spotify or google maps when your phone is locked but not off would be a great addition.","The leaderboard feels to competitive for something meant to help you yourself focus.","Once a week","1","1","Lots of apps have a similar layout which means that people are probably already used to this style.","I think more polishing is all it needs.","I don't have an android phone/tablet"
